          I love listening to music and I love playing music. There is no better way to 
          decorate time than with music. I am multi instrumentalist, I primarily play 
          guitar but I also play bass, drums as well as some piano.

        <div mb-2>
          <strong> Bachelor in Software Engineering 2021-2025</strong><br>
          Concordia University, Montreal, QC<br><br>
          I am a soon to be graduate from Concordia University. In this degree,
          I acquired the skills necessary for a Software Engineer such as experience 
          in various programming languages, skills, code architecture, code management, 
          code testing, website design, engineering standards, hardware components, 
          system security and operating systems.
          In my software electives, I took courses that seem interesting to me such
          as machine learning, artificial intelligence and advanced C++.<br><br>
          </div>
          <div mb-2>
          <strong>Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry 2018-2021</strong><br>
          Concordia University, Montreal, QC<br><br>
          Prior to switching to Software Engineering in 2021, I was a Biochemistry
          student. I find chemistry, biology and the rest of the sciences really
          interesting, but I did not see myself working in those fields. During my
          time in this degree, I completed courses on Biochemistry analytical, physical, 
          organic and inorganic chemistry. I also completed a genetics course as well as
          general electives such as finance and macro-economics.<br><br>
          </div>
          <div mb-2>
          <strong>Diplôme d'Études Collégiale en Programme de la Santé 2016-2018</strong><br>
          Vanier College, Montreal, QC<br><br>
          In Cegep, I followed a health science program and took psychology and 
          design as my elective courses. I also really enjoyed writing for my english
          and humanities courses and I really enjoyed my orienteering physical education
          course.<br><br>
          </div>
          <div mb-2>
          <strong>Diplôme d'Études Secondaire en Math TS 2011-2016</strong><br>
          École Secondaire Mont-Royal, Montreal, QC<br><br>
          In high school, I did the international program which involves doing a project
          during the final year. I really liked cars, so my presentation was about the history
          of cars. I also did advanced math and graphic design.<br><br>

          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <div mb-2>
            <strong>UI/UX Design Intern Summer 2024</strong><br>
            Matrox, Montreal, QC<br><br>
            During my studies in the Sotware Engineering program, I did an internship at Matrox. 
            It was not part of my program requirements but I wanted to learn more about UI/UX as 
            well as obtain experience in the field. I can break down my experience at Matrox 
            into three categories:<br><br>
            <strong>1) UI/UX design:</strong> I worked on designing web pages for Matrox products as well as 
            emails for events. I implemented various dynamic Javascript elements, responsive 
            designs and type checking in fields. For email design, I had to ensure compatibility 
            across all email clients (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) for both desktop and mobile.<br><br>
            <strong>2) Ops & Automation:</strong> I developed modularized HTML/CSS templates for webpages and emails 
            that can be re-used and customized by the team. Beyond my regular duties, I 
            developed a Python program, which includes a user interface enabling the designer 
            to add or remove web page elements in the webpage template easily. The result of my work 
            are various user-friendly and error-proof tools that allow the Marketing team to quickly 
            customize product pages and emails without any coding knowledge.<br><br>
            <strong>3) Agile environment:</strong> All tasks were tracked in a Kanban board and daily meetings were 
            held to ensure project alignment. Weekly sprint meetings were helpd to review our 
            progress, set goals for the upcoming week, and address any roadblocks encountered. 
            Additionally, I regularly communicated with product managers to get approval for my 
            designs and adapting to evolving requirements and product specifications.

          Bureau Veritas, Montreal, QC<br><br>
          After completing a year in Biochemistry, I was employed at Bureau Veritas. During the 
          2020 pandemic, I switched to Software Engineering and continued working at Bureau 
          Veritas throughout the first three years of my studies.<br><br>
          In this lab, we test food samples and surface swabs for food born pathogens such as 
          listeria, salmonella, E.coli O157 among others. My position involved receiving 
          samples and communicating with clients and customer-service, processing the samples 
          during production and analyze the sample after incubation.<br><br>

              For my Capstone graduation project, my team and I developed Fixer, a platform to connect 
              trade technicians with clients needing services. The app is built using the React Native 
              framework and integrates various APIs, including MongoDB for database management and 
              StreamIO for live chat functionalities. We used Git for version control and achieved high 
              testing coverage with Jest for unit testing and the new Moropo for end-to-end testing. 
            </span><br>
            <h2 mb-2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <span mb-2>
              In addition to React Native, MongoDB, StreamIO and Git, we used Expo to develop and to 
              emulate our application. Jest was used for unit testing and the new Moropo was
              used for end-to-end testing. The Google Maps API in combination with react-native-maps were 
              used for the job map. WebStorm was used as the IDE and Github hosting and documention.

              I am interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence so much so that I chose it as a 
              course. This project compares and evaluates convolutional neural networks (CNN) that uses a 
              Resnet-18 trained on a 6000 image dataset with 3 categories of cancer cells and another pre-trained
              Resnet-50. This project was done using PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, MatplotLib and Pandas.

            <h2 mb-2>Models and Datasets</h2>
            <span mb-2>
              The Resnet-18 was trained on dataset 1 while the Resnet-50 is the available Resnet-50 from PyTorch.
              Both models are then tested on datsets 2 (other type of cancer cells with 3 categories) and
              dataset 3 (unapologetically cute cats, dogs and wildlife) for feature extraction using t-SNE.

            <span mb-2>
              Furthermore, the Resnet-18's feature extraction of Dataset 2 is evaluated using supervised learning
              and unsupervised learning, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.
