          I love listening to music and I love playing music. There is no better way to 
          decorate time than with music. I am multi instrumentalist, I primarily play 
          guitar but I also play bass, drums as well as some piano.

          In fact, I play with a band called The Hucks. We released our second album in
          2023 and are currently working on the third. You can play our music right here. 
          Enjoy!

          system security and operating systems.
