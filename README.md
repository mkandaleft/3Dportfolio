# 3Dportfolio
## By Mark Kandaleft

Hello and Welcome!

This repository is for my 3D personal website that I am developping to demonstrates my career, skills, projects and music. It is my way of showing my creative side in software.

The web app uses Vite.js for development and the Three.js library for the 3D scene and the camera. The project also uses Tailwind css for styling and Vercel for deployment and Github Pages for [Documentation](https://mkandaleft.github.io/3Dportfolio/).

## Running Webapp

To visit the web app, simply click on this [link](https://3dportfolio-rho.vercel.app/).

### OR

To run your own copy of the app on your local machine, assuming you already have Node.js, follow these steps:

1) Navigate to desired directory and clone repository:
```BASH
    git clone https://github.com/mkandaleft/3Dportfolio.git
```
2) Install dependencies:
```BASH
    npm install
```
3) Run the app:
```BASH
    npm run dev
```

## Project Organization

The project contains the following relevant folders/files:
- /docs used to generate and format documentation
- /public used to store 3D models and images
- /src contains the js classes and main.js
- index.html contains the content of all the pages and hidden texts for objects
- style.css contains the css styling elements of index.html

## Current State of Webapp

As of this moment, the web app works on most platforms with a keyboard and a mouse/touchpad. This means it is currently unavailable for phones since there are not controls in place. The webapp might be slow and laggy at first and that is because of the different capabilities of certain machines to render 3D models. If your machine is below-average and it lags at first, give it a minute to allow the models to load.

Currently you can view the four corners of the webapp which are Career, Projects, Software Skills and Music. More features are under development, such as:
- Signs with the actual name of the corner
- More projects in the project corner
- Screens will display an image when you get close to them
- A central console will be added to the scene to view other information
- Objects that interact with users such as the objects that will be on the shelves in the skills
- A better background and prettier overall scene
- Improvment in the content display when aiming zoomed in to text
- More controls such as jumping and escaping zoom with escape

## Rights of Use

The code for this app is open to viewing and cloning. If you would like to modify this code for your given project, feel free to do so there is even documentation for the classes. Simply give me credits in your README.md.

I did not start this app from scratch, I myself used the code originally by [simondevyoutube](https://github.com/simondevyoutube). His code provided me with the basics of the camera movement and scene initialization and can be viewed on his Github repository [ThreeJS_Tutorial_FirstPersonCamera](https://github.com/simondevyoutube/ThreeJS_Tutorial_FirstPersonCamera.git).

Moreover, most the 3D models are from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/feed) and the license for each of the models I used can be found with 3D model files in public and will contain the link to the download pages.
